# Learn Front End Development
Coding languages and tools for front end web/mobile development.
This guide will always contain the latest technologies that i personally use to my daily work.
Tools/technologies i deprecate over my work will also be removed from this guide.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, dynamic styling, animation). Alongside with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. 

You need to know that JavaScript is:

* [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) - like many other languages!
* [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) - pay attention here!
* with [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) - functions are treated as first class citizens!

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.
Created by Mozilla (back then it was called Netscape) engineers, there is no better place for documentation than the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) in Mozilla Developer Network.

## AngularJS-v1
AngularJS is an MV* framework that is ideal for use when building client-side single-page apps. It is not a library, but a framework for building dynamic web pages. It focuses on extending HTML and providing dynamic data binding. Instead of manipulating the DOM “directly,” you annotate your DOM with metadata (directives), and Angular manipulates the DOM for you. Angular is ideal for single-page application ([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) development.

Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced. Get in speed with AngularJS by starting with the links below:
