Coding languages and tools for front end web/mobile development.
This guide will always contain the latest technologies that i personally use to my daily work.
Tools/technologies i deprecate over my work will also be removed from this guide.

### Languages
##### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, dynamic styling, animation). Alongside with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. 

A few things about JavaScript you should definatelly know before you start learning it in depth; JS is:

* [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)
* [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming)
* [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)
* with [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.
Created by Netscape (today's Mozilla) engineers, there is no better place for documentation than the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) in Mozilla Developer Network.

* Events
 * **Quick Definition:** DOM Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the Event interface.

### Frameworks
##### AngularJS v1
AngularJS is an MV* framework that is ideal for use when building client-side single-page apps. It is not a library, but a framework for building dynamic web pages. It focuses on extending HTML and providing dynamic data binding. Instead of manipulating the DOM “directly,” you annotate your DOM with metadata (directives), and Angular manipulates the DOM for you. Angular is ideal for single-page application ([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) development.

Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced. Get in speed with AngularJS by starting with the links below:
