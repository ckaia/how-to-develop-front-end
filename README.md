##### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).

A few things you definatelly need to know about JavaScript if you want to understand it in depth. It is:
* [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)
* [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming)
* [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)
* with [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)

programming language. Alongside with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. 

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.
Created by Netscape (today's Mozilla) engineers, there is no better place for documentation than the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) in Mozilla Developer Network.
