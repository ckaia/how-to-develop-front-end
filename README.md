Coding languages and tools for front end web/mobile development.
This guide will always contain the latest technologies that i personally use to my daily work.
Tools/technologies i deprecate over my work will also be removed from this guide.

### Languages
##### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).

A few things you definatelly need to know about JavaScript if you want to understand it in depth. It is:
* [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)
* [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming)
* [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)
* with [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)

programming language. Alongside with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. 

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.
Created by Netscape (today's Mozilla) engineers, there is no better place for documentation than the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) in Mozilla Developer Network.

### Frameworks
##### AngularJS v1
AngularJS is a complete JavaScript-based open-source client and server-side web application framework mainly maintained by Google to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. 

A single-page application ([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) is a web application where either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process.

AngularJS  aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller ([MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) and model–view–viewmodel ([MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)) architectures. Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced.
